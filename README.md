## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I started this project because I wanted to try the light/dark theme. I also tried to finish it within an hour but setting all the custom properties and writing html alone took about an hour. It was a great experience working with a ton of custom properties.

### Continued development

I wanted to train JavaScript but this unfortunately didn't include much of it. I plan to take more advanced JS projects.
